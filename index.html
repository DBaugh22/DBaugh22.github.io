            <p><b>Commit</b></p>
            
           <p>Commit in GitHub means you are essentially taking screenshots of the progress of your code throughout a project. This can include anytime you make any changes to the code and who has made these changes. It is a useful tool to see how your code and end product has improved over time.</p>

           <p><b>Branches</b></p>
           <p>Branches in GitHub are a way for developers to improve and also adding a new feature with code in to the software. You have the main branch or master which is the core of the software. Any extra features that you add, are extra branches that are attached to the main branch to make the final product.</p>

           <p><b>Pull Request</b></p>
           <p>Pull requests are used in GitHub and can also be called merge requests. They are used for collaborators to inform each other of any changed that have been made to a branch in GitHub. When a pull request has been opened, collaborators can discuss the changes that have been made and also discuss potential future changes which can be applied to the software.</p>

           <p><b>Other Useful Information</b></p>
           <p>In GitHub you can set up team discussions which allows you to post updates and discuss any plans for future updates. This sends out a notification to your team or even your Github organisation. You can set branches so that only certain people can work on that branch. You can also assign people to pull requests or to work on an issue that has occurred. This is a good feature as it lets you control who works on what section and also reduces the chance of conflict.</p>

           <h2>Unix Shell</h2>

           <p><b>Listing Files in a Directory</b></p>
           <p>To list the files that are in the directory that you are viewing on Unix Shell, simply type "ls" and press enter and you shall see and list of the files inside the directory.</p>

           <p><b>Showing and Changing Directories</b></p>
           <p>Similar to the above with listing files in a directory, to show directories enter "ls" to see the available directories. To change directories, enter "cd (name of directory)" from there you can view files in that directory.</p>

           <p><b>Creating a New Directory</b></p>
           <p>To create a new directory use the command "cd (then the location you would like to have your directory in)". Once you have chosen and are at the location where you want to create a new directory, enter "mkdir (the name of your directory)". Once you have done this you will have a new directory for you to save and create files in.</p>

           <p><b>Creating and Removing Files</b></p>
           <p>To create a file in Unix Shell, you first need to navigate to the directory where you want the file to be in. There are 2 different ways of creating files on Unix Shell. The first method is "Nano" in which you enter "nano (name of the file).txt". The other way of creating a file is "touch (name of the file).txt" Once you have done these, to check that the file has in fact been created you can simply enter "ls" to list the files in that directory. To remove files from a directory, simply enter "rm (name of the file you would like to delete" Once this is done you will be unable to get the file back! So be careful you only enter files that you never need to use again.</p>
